                  The automobile industry is currently going through large
                  changes in relation to sustainable production, moving from
                  selling products to selling a service, and changing views of
                  ownership. Our mission was to examine ways in which Volvo
                  could work with these changes and develop a service that
                  aligns with Volvos values and provides a service that is
                  environmentally, socially and economicaly sustainable. Our
                  work led to a completely new concept, called Share by Volvo.
                  This shared-subscription model solves several issues related
                  to automobile ownership, enabling users to only subscribe to
                  a car as much or little as they need to.

                  As one of five UX Designers and UX Researchers, I was responsible for conducting brainstorming
                  sessions, creating prototypes in Figma, integrating environmental and sustainability considerations,
                  developing storyboards, and performing desktop research. My focus was on ensuring the design aligned
                  with Volvo’s values and addressed the needs of future users.

                  Anna, our persona from the (near) future, was created early on in the project to guide future
                  decisions
                  and ensure we always kept our main stakeholder in mind. Anna is a representation of many different
                  Volvo
                  users, fused together into one dynamic person. She is the result of both our own user research and
                  Volvo's user data. Anna is also designed to describe the needs of users in the near future, in modern
                  societies.
                  <br><br>The service will be used by people who don’t need a car every day, but whose lives could be
                  made
                  easier by having one sometimes. Single-parent households, students, flex- workers, and people living
                  in
                  urban environments close to work are some of our primary stakeholders, as their needs fit well into a
                  sharing economy.

                <p>
                  Before developing the service, we chose to focus on imagining what societies might look like in the
                  near
                  future. This would help us figure out how car ownership might fit into this reality. Anticipating an
                  increase in remote work, we foresee a shift in the way people live and work. The trend of urban
                  migration also suggests a higher concentration of people living in close proximity. Additionally,
                  despite the initial higher cost, we expect electric cars to become more prevalent.
                  <br><br>In light of these factors, questions arise about traditional car ownership. Does everyone
                  truly
                  need full-time access to a personal car? What if the cost of individual ownership is prohibitive?
                  Could
                  neighbours share a car? With these considerations in mind, our focus turned towards creating a
                  platform
                  where people can manage ownership, participate in the sharing economy, and book cars as needed. Such a
                  platform has the potential to save time and money, reduce the need for extensive parking
                  infrastructure,
                  and contribute to environmental well-being.

                  Through desktop research on economic sustainability and the sharing economy, we developed a
                  subscription model based on usage. The idea was that if you only needed a car once a week, you
                  shouldn’t have to pay for the other six days. This concept became the foundation for "Share by Volvo."
                  Our final design introduced a flexible subscription model where users could purchase shares of a car
                  based on their needs. For instance, a parent who requires a car only 50% of the time could subscribe
                  accordingly, sharing ownership and paying proportionately less.

                  To illustrate user interaction with the service, we created a storyboard. This approach was used to
                  demonstrate how the service could function in future scenarios, using conceptual visualization over a
                  finished product. The storyboard depicted a user scenario of our persona Anna, sharing a car with
                  neighbors.

                  We created wireframes and prototypes in Figma to visualize how the service would work. These
                  prototypes included user interfaces for the subscription platform and mobile application, showcasing
                  features such as subscription management, communication tools for co-owners, and scheduling
                  capabilities. The prototypes were designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, focusing on ease of use
                  and accessibility.

                  The Share the Care model presents a thoughtful solution that addresses economic, social, and
                  environmental sustainability. By combining innovative subscription models, user-friendly interfaces,
                  and
                  an emphasis on community building, this project offers a holistic approach to redefining future car
                  subscriptions toward a more sustainable direction. To illustrate the concept, a storyboard, a report
                  and
                  mixed fidelity wireframes were delivered.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We also recognized the potential to expand the customer reach by introducing a flexible, shareable
                  subscription model. The traditional car subscription model often caters to individuals with higher
                  incomes, but by making car access more inclusive and economically viable for a broader audience,
                  including those with irregular or lower incomes, we aimed to broaden the appeal of the service.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We also addressed the varied needs of different user groups. Recognizing that not everyone requires
                  constant access to a car, our design allows for partial subscriptions. For instance, parents with
                  shared custody or individuals who work remotely can subscribe to a car only when needed, reducing
                  costs and optimizing resource use.

                  One insight gained from this project is the importance of imposing creative limitations to facilitate
                  a
                  more efficient generation of ideas. Given Volvo's robust brand presence, clearly defined values,
                  target
                  audience, and established graphic profile, we had a well- defined scope to operate within. In many
                  projects, it can be challenging to determine where to commence or which direction to explore when
                  faced
                  with numerous options. Employing a set of rules proved to be an effective method for concentrating on
                  what can and should be accomplished. Additionally, this project served as a valuable exercise in
                  creativity, as we aimed to conceptualize an entirely new idea within the established scope rather than
                  merely enhancing an existing concept.

                  The National Park Service is a federal agency that manages the national parks of the USA. As part of
                  their efforts to enable millions of people to enjoy the natural beauty of the American landscape, they
                  have developed an app to help users find information about anything related to different parks. The
                  problem is that the application, in its current form, provides too much information at a time. This
                  makes the app hard to navigate, which leads to frustration and makes the national parks seem less
                  accessible. Our goal was to identify user goals, painpoints, and redesign the app to better suit these
                  purposes.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As a UX Designer and UI Designer, I worked closely with another designer to conduct user research,
                  create wireframes, prototype designs, and oversee user testing.

                  Think-aloud tests was used to evaluate the design both before and after our intervention. We provided
                  participants with a list of tasks to complete (find a specific park, find accommodation, etc.) while
                  speaking out loud about their thought process. To keep distractions to a minimum, participants were
                  encouraged to provide their feedback in whatever language they felt most comfortable using. All
                  participant chose to think aloud in korean, which my partner then translated for me, enabling us both
                  to ask follow-up questions.

                  <br>
                  The think-aloud tests done before our intervention provided valuable insights into the usability of
                  the current workflow and design system and allowed us to identify areas that needed improvement. For
                  example, through the think-aloud tests, we were able to identify that participants had a hard time
                  navigating the complex filter system, which slowed down users flow and caused frustration when using
                  the app.

                <p>We began the process by creating a flowchart to outline a more efficient user flow. The key design
                  improvements included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Direct filtering on the homepage:</b> Instead of burying filters under multiple
                    clicks, we placed essential filters (location, activities, and services) directly on the landing
                    page.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Reducing cognitive load:</b> Using <em>Gestalt principles</em>, we improved visual
                    clarity by grouping related information, helping users focus on primary actions without unnecessary
                    distractions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We then moved on to wireframing and prototyping:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Wireframes & Prototyping:</b> Starting with low-fidelity wireframes in Figma, we
                    explored various layouts. These evolved into high-fidelity prototypes, which were refined based on
                    feedback from both internal teams and user testing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To ensure consistency in the design, we created a <b>graphic manual</b> covering key
                  elements like colors, font sizes, margins, padding, and grids. This manual served as a reference
                  throughout the design process. After incorporating text and images, we shared the refined design with
                  other teams, whose feedback was helpful in fine-tuning the final product.</p>

                  improvements included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Simplifying the filter system:</b> We removed unnecessary categories and made
                    important filters (such as park location, activities, and accommodations) accessible directly from
                    the homepage. This reduced the number of clicks and made it easier for users to find parks that met
                    their criteria.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Clear visual hierarchy:</b> By applying <em>Gestalt laws</em>, we grouped related
                    information and ensured high-priority content (e.g., park descriptions and available facilities)
                    stood out. This minimized information overload and improved overall clarity.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Mobile-first design:</b> We optimized the app for mobile users, implementing a
                    responsive design that works seamlessly on smaller screens, improving the experience for users on
                    all devices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These improvements not only saved users several steps in navigating the app, but also reduced
                  cognitive load by focusing attention on the most relevant information. As a result, the app became
                  more intuitive and aligned with the NPS's mission to make park information more accessible and easier
                  to use.</p>

                  <br>
                  One of the main challenges was accommodating the wide range of user types, from seasoned hikers to
                  casual visitors. We had to strike a balance between simplifying the experience for beginners while
                  still offering depth for experienced users.

                  <b>02: Prioritizing Content</b><br><br>
                  The app had a lot of important content (park regulations, weather, trails, etc.). Deciding which
                  information to feature prominently required careful consideration to avoid overwhelming users.

                  This project underscored the significance of clearly defining the goal of the service being designed.
                  Initially, the NPS application appeared to be a well-functioning tool in its current form. However,
                  upon attempting to use it for its primary intended purpose, our research revealed its shortcomings.
                  Our redesign successfully enhanced the user experience by ensuring alignment with the intended goal.
                  For future projects, I will make sure to have a clear understanding of the project owner's
                  expectations and their objectives for the end user, to make sure I design something that is useful in
                  the way it’s intended to be.

                  The aluminum production process is highly complex and every step of the production line can have an
                  effect on the final product. Sellers and buyers often encounter misunderstandings caused by different
                  expectations. When customers aren’t satisfied with the product they receive, they may ask for refunds,
                  which leads to huge costs for suppliers, and increased delivery time for buyers. There currently isn’t
                  a good and reliable way to communicate expectations clearly. Our mission was to find out what causes
                  the misunderstandings, present a conceptual model of the aluminum manufacturing process, and deliver a
                  prototype for an app that could be used by stakeholders.

                  As the lead UX designer and team leader, I was responsible for ensuring the project aligned with
                  deadlines, contacting stakeholders, and overseeing the design and development process, helping out
                  where I was needed most.

                  To understand what needed to be done, we decided early on to create a simple conceptual interaction
                  with the service. Without defining the features or practical interactions with the app, we wanted to
                  understand the desired outcome. The use case scenario was shown to the project owner and some
                  stakeholders during user tests, to make sure our vision aligned with what they wanted.

                  We conducted several interviews with different actors within the production chain. All of them agreed
                  that there is a lack of communication. The interviews also showed us that the problems not only arise
                  between the seller and buyer, but also within different actors in the chain. As an example, the
                  temperature with which someone brings the aluminum to during shaping will have an effect on the
                  paintjob. Since the shaper and painter usually work in different factories, they often don’t
                  communicate these things. The interviews also showed that shipment is a large part of the issues that
                  arise, since packing will have an effect on damages and cost.

                  Follow-up interviews were conducted to make sure we were going in the right direction. WIreframes and
                  storyboards were used to illustrate potential uses and interactions. Stakeholder opinions were written
                  down and helped us iterate the design further.

                  Persona hypotheses were initially created based on desktop research. These were refined after
                  stakeholder interviews to better represent the target users' needs and goals. The personas helped the
                  team understand the different perspectives within the industry and guided the design process.

                  We developed wireframes to outline the structure and layout of the service. Wireframes provided a

                  Using Figma, we created a high-fidelity prototype with interactive elements. This prototype allowed us

                  Upon project completion, we presented an interactive prototype to multiple stakeholders involved in
                  the project. This prototype, rooted in insights obtained from our research, served as the initial step
                  toward a finalized, fully integrated product. Additionally, we offered the project owners
                  recommendations for ongoing development, encompassing suggested research areas and necessary design
                  decisions. A report describing the entire process, insights included, was also provided to the project

                  The value of user insight. As we were navigation within a field that we knew nothing about, it was the
                  insights gathered from stakeholders that made the project possible. Having the expertise of
                  stakeholder enabled us to focus on what we were good at, which is UX design. An added bonus was that
                  the stakeholders became more interested in and excited about the project because they were now a big
                  part of the design process, rather than just being project owners.

                  Agile work was a huge part of this process. I learned to be relaxed and adaptive to change and not
                  worry too much about the process set up in the beginning. Responding to change and modifying the plan,
                  rather than strictly following a pre-set plan, proved to be a great ability for this project. I will
                  keep this in mind for further projects as well.

              <p>
                A research project by Halmstad University and industry
                stakeholders aimed to create a new industry standard for
                classifying aluminum. My team and I supported this by
                identifying pain points, interviewing stakeholders, and
                creating user journeys to develop a prototype sales
                application. We also contributed to information architecture.
                As the lead UX designer and team leader, I ensured the project
                met deadlines and guided developers, UI designers, and UX
                writers.
